# Stats preview card component

This is a great small challenge to help get you used to building to a design. There's no JS in this project, so you'll be able to focus on your HTML & CSS skills.

Your challenge is to build out this card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
